### Merge function detailed explanation

```
function merge(left, right) {
    let result = [];
    let leftIndex = 0;
    let rightIndex = 0;

    while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {
        if (left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex]) {
            result.push(left[leftIndex]);
            leftIndex++;
        } else {
            result.push(right[rightIndex]);
            rightIndex++;
        }
    }

    while (leftIndex < left.length) {
        result.push(left[leftIndex]);
        leftIndex++;
    }

    while (rightIndex < right.length) {
        result.push(right[rightIndex]);
        rightIndex++;
    }

    return result;
}
```

##### 1. Initialization

- The `result` array is an empty array that will eventually contain the merged result of the two sorted arrays `left` and `right`.
- `leftIndex` and `rightIndex` are pointers initialized to the beginning of the left and right arrays respectively.

##### 2. Comparative loop

`while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {
    ...
}
`

This loop continues as long as there are elements in both `left` and `right` arrays to be considered. The core idea here is to compare the current elements of both arrays and push the smaller one to the `result` array.

- If the current element of `left` is smaller, it's added to the result, and the `leftIndex` is incremented to move to the next element in the `left` array.
- Otherwise, the current element of `right` is added to the result, and the `rightIndex` is incremented.

##### 3. Remaining elements

After the comparative loop, at least one of the arrays (`left` or `right`) will have been completely added to the `result`. But the other might still have elements left (although only one of the two subsequent loops will actually run):

`while (leftIndex < left.length) { ... }`
`while (rightIndex < right.length) { ... }`

These loops ensure that any remaining elements from either `left` or `right` are added to `result`.

##### 4. Return result

Finally, the merged array result is returned.

#### Time Complexity Analysis of `merge`:

For analyzing the time complexity, consider the following:

- The size of left is `n/2` and the size of right is `n/2` (approximately, if `n` is even).
- In the worst case, you'd run the comparative loop n times (because you're comparing and adding each element to the `result` array exactly once).

Thus, the time complexity of the `merge` function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in `left` and `right` combined.

It's important to note that while the merging step is linear, the overall Merge Sort algorithm has a logarithmic number of these merge steps (due to the recursive division of the input), resulting in the overall O(n log n) complexity of the Merge Sort algorithm.
