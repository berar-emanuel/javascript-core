### Summary

Currying in JavaScript is a functional programming technique that involves transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions, each taking a single argument. This transformation allows you to partially apply arguments to a function and create new functions with specific configurations. Currying can be useful for creating reusable and composable functions.

In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, which means you can treat them like any other data type, including passing them as arguments to other functions and returning them from functions. Currying leverages this feature to break down a multi-argument function into a series of single-argument functions.

### Business case

Imagine you are developing a messaging application, and you want to create a system for handling and formatting different types of messages, such as text messages, image messages, and video messages. In this scenario, currying can help you design a flexible and extensible system for processing and formatting these messages.

```javascript
// Define a message formatting function
function formatMessage(sender) {
  return function (messageType) {
    return function (content) {
      return `${sender} sent a ${messageType} message: ${content}`;
    };
  };
}

// Create a partial function for a specific user
const aliceMessage = formatMessage('Alice');

// Create a partial function for a text message
const textMessage = aliceMessage('text');

// Create a partial function for an image message
const imageMessage = aliceMessage('image');

// Create a partial function for a video message
const videoMessage = aliceMessage('video');

// Use the partial functions to format messages
console.log(textMessage('Hello, Bob!')); // Output: "Alice sent a text message: Hello, Bob!"
console.log(imageMessage('image123.jpg')); // Output: "Alice sent an image message: image123.jpg"
console.log(videoMessage('video456.mp4')); // Output: "Alice sent a video message: video456.mp4"
```

### Walkthrough

1. We define a `formatMessage` function that takes the `sender`, `messageType`, and `content` as separate arguments and returns a formatted message string.

2. We then use currying to create partial functions for specific senders and message types. For instance, `aliceMessage` is a partial function for Alice, and `textMessage`, `imageMessage`, and `videoMessage` are partial functions for different message types.

3. With these partial functions, we can easily format messages for Alice without repeating her name and specifying the message type every time.

This approach allows you to extend your messaging application in the future by adding new message types or customizing the formatting behavior for specific users without changing the core logic of the `formatMessage` function. It promotes code reusability, maintainability, and flexibility, making it easier to adapt to changing business requirements in your messaging application.
