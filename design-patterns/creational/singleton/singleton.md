### Summary

The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In the context of a text messaging application, we can use the Singleton pattern to ensure that there is only one instance of the messaging service throughout the application.

#### Business case

Messaging application that supports sending different types of messages, such as text messages and image messages.

#### Walkthrough

1. The `MessagingService` class is defined as a Singleton. It has a private static property `instance`, which holds the single instance of the class.

2. The constructor of the `MessagingService` class checks whether the `instance` property already exists. If it does, it returns the existing instance, preventing the creation of a new instance. If not, it initializes the messaging service and stores the instance in the `instance` property.

3. The `sendMessage(content)` method allows us to send messages, and the messages are stored in the `messages` array.

4. The `getMessages()` method is used to retrieve all messages stored in the `messages` array.

5. In the usage example, we create two instances of the `MessagingService`, but due to the Singleton pattern, both variables (`messagingService1` and `messagingService2`) will point to the same instance. This ensures that there is only one messaging service throughout the application.

By implementing the Singleton pattern, we ensure that there is a single instance of the messaging service across the entire application. This prevents duplication of resources and ensures that all components of the application can use the same messaging service to send and retrieve messages.
