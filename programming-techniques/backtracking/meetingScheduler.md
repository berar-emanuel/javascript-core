### Summary

1. The `doMeetingsOverlap` function checks if two meetings overlap by comparing their start and end times. If they overlap, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
2. The `scheduleMeetings` function is the backtracking function. It takes `meetings` (the list of meetings), `rooms` (an array representing the rooms and their scheduled meetings), and `currentRoomIndex` (the index of the current meeting to be scheduled).
3. The base case of the backtracking is when all meetings are scheduled (i.e., `currentRoomIndex` equals the number of meetings). In this case, we have found a valid schedule, so we return `true`.
4. We iterate over all available rooms and check if the current meeting can be scheduled in each room without overlapping with any already scheduled meeting.
5. If a room is available, we schedule the current meeting in that room and proceed to schedule the next meeting by making a recursive call to the `scheduleMeetings` function with `currentRoomIndex + 1`.
6. If the recursive call returns `true`, it means we have found a valid schedule, so we propagate the `true` value back.
7. If the recursive call returns `false`, we need to backtrack by removing the current meeting from the room (i.e., popping it from the room's array) and try the next available room.
8. If none of the rooms can accommodate the current meeting without overlapping, the function returns `false`, indicating that there is no suitable schedule.
9. In the example usage, we have four meetings with different start and end times and two available rooms. The function is called with the `meetings` array and an array representing the rooms as empty arrays. If a suitable schedule is found, it will be printed with meetings assigned to each room. Otherwise, a message indicating that no suitable schedule was found will be displayed.
